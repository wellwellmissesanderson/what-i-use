Someone: Hey ~wes~ Heather what settings do you use?

Me: Mostly stuff from Wes.

These are my config setting for various apps, editors and linters. I'd suggest not copying them directly but referencing what I have and what ones might make sense for you.

These are constantly changing as I work on different types of projects so I don't necessarily always have an answer to "y do u do ____ instead of ____"

The folder workspace-settings has a few workspace settings I like when using multiple projects (ex workspace colours change, so it's supah easy to tell the difference between sets of codez!)

🚲 ((((Enjoy))))! 😘
